# Buzzy-Bee

## Description

Buzzy-Bee work day scheduler was created to organize a busy day to enhance productivity. Development of this project is to help user plan out daily schedules to prevent scheduling conflicts. The developer intended to solve the possiblity of overlapping schedules, missing appointments, etc. In the process, the use of DOM traversals made it simpler to grab and save input into each time-block and the understanding of truly breaking down eac step of the acceptance criteria  to really target what is being sought after in the user story.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Step 1: Open scheduler. Note: the current date should always appear in the header below the title and subtitle.

Step 2: Each time block for standard work day should appear on the screen.(9AM-6PM)

Step 3:Each time-block is color coded for past, present, and future times. So, past times would be grey, present time would be red, and future times would be green.

Step 4: Click on the text box to enter your plans. 

Step 5: Click the blue save button to input your plans for each timeframe.

Step 6: When the page is refreshed, the user would see the save events remain in place.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    
    ![current date](./assets/images/current_date.png)
    ![time block](./assets/images/time-blocks.png)
    ![past, present, future](./assets/images/past_present_future.png)
    ![enter text](./assets/images/enter_text.png)
    ![save](./assets/images/save_event.png)
